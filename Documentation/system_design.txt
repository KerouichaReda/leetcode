Design a content delivery network (CDN).
Use globally distributed edge servers to cache content, reducing latency, and routing requests via DNS.

Design a recommendation engine (e.g., Netflix recommendations).
Use collaborative or content-based filtering with a NoSQL database to store user behavior and content metadata.

Design a rate limiter system.
Use token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms with Redis to limit requests and prevent abuse.

Design a real-time analytics system (e.g., web traffic monitoring).
Use stream processing frameworks like Kafka and Spark, and store data in time-series databases.

Design a microservices architecture for a large application.
Use REST APIs for communication, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration.

Design a distributed job scheduler.
Use a distributed queue (e.g., RabbitMQ), with worker nodes to process tasks concurrently.

Design a highly available database system.
Use replication, sharding, and consistent hashing to ensure fault tolerance and scalability.

Design a search engine.
Use an inverted index to map keywords to documents and employ ranking algorithms like PageRank.

Design an online ticket booking system (e.g., for movies, flights).
Use a relational database for seat reservations, with a real-time system for concurrency control.

Design a payment gateway system.
Use encryption for security, integrate with external payment providers, and implement fraud detection.

Design a location-based service (e.g., Uber).
Use real-time GPS data and geospatial indexing for ride dispatching and tracking.

Design a real-time collaboration platform (e.g., Google Docs).
Use WebSockets for live editing, CRDTs for conflict-free concurrent updates, and distributed storage.

Design a video conferencing system (e.g., Zoom).
Use WebRTC for peer-to-peer video/audio streaming and TURN/STUN servers for NAT traversal.

Design a blogging platform.
Use a NoSQL database for posts, tags, and comments, with caching for high-traffic content.

Design a notification system.
Use push notifications with a message queue to ensure scalability and delivery reliability.

Design a URL redirection service (e.g., 301 redirect).
Store original URLs and their redirection URLs in a key-value store and redirect based on the key.

Design a voting system (e.g., elections).
Use a relational database for votes, implement safeguards against duplicate voting, and ensure privacy.

Design a file sharing service.
Store files in cloud storage, use a database for user and permission management, and implement file versioning.

Design a job queue system (e.g., for background tasks).
Use a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka to manage queues, with workers to process jobs.

Design a system for sending emails.
Use an SMTP server to send emails, with a database for managing email queues and delivery logs.

Design a cloud-based analytics dashboard.
Use a distributed data storage system and a dashboard frontend that queries real-time analytics data.

Design a file compression service.
Use compression algorithms (e.g., gzip) to reduce file size and store compressed files in cloud storage.

Design a monitoring system for server health.
Use a distributed system to collect metrics, store them in a time-series database, and use alerts based on thresholds.
